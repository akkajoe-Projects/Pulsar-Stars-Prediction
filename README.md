# Predicting Pulsar Stars among Neutron Stars
Applying the XGBClassifier machine learning model to predict the 0 and 1 classes in the test dataset, i.e, x_test.
0- Negative class
1- Positive Class

Each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables and a single class variable.

1. The mean of the integrated profile.
2. The standard deviation of the integrated profile.
3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.
4. The skewness of the integrated profile.
5. The mean of the DM-SNR curve.
6. The standard deviation of the DM-SNR curve.
7. Excess kurtosis of the DM-SNR curve.
8. The skewness of the DM-SNR curve.
